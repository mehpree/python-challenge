# Python Challenge - PyBank and PyPoll
Welcome to the Python Challenge project! Let's take a closer look at the tasks completed in PyBank and PyPoll.

**PyBank Challenge - Financial Analysis**
![Alt text](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)
Tasks Accomplished:

- Total Months Analysis: I've successfully determined the total number of months included in the financial dataset.

- Net Total Analysis: The Python script has calculated the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire dataset.

- Change Analysis: I've computed the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and found the average of those changes, providing crucial insights into financial trends.

- Profit Peaks and Valleys: The script also identifies the periods with the greatest increase and decrease in profits, providing dates and corresponding amounts.

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

```
**PyPoll Challenge - Election Analysis**

Tasks Accomplished:

- Total Votes Analysis: The Python script has efficiently calculated the total number of votes cast in the election.

- Candidates Analysis: I've compiled a complete list of candidates who received votes, providing a clear picture of the field.

- Vote Percentage Analysis: The script has determined the percentage of votes each candidate won, revealing the popularity of each candidate.

- Vote Tally Analysis: I've also calculated the total number of votes each candidate received, allowing us to understand their overall support.

- Election Winner: The Python script identifies the winner of the election based on the popular vote, ensuring transparency in the results.

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369711
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
-------------------------
```

Just like in the PyBank challenge, the final script for PyPoll not only displays this election analysis in the terminal but also exports it to a text file for further reference.

## Conclusion
In summary, this Python Challenge project has successfully tackled real-world problems in both financial analysis and election analysis. Whether you're exploring the code or seeking insights from the results, this project offers valuable examples of data analysis using Python. Happy exploring!
